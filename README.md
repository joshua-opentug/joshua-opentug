- 👋 Hi, I’m @joshua-opentug
- 👀 I’m interested in ...  digitizing the maritime industry of tugboats, freight, and more
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... solid framework and python as it applies to maritime industry
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... solid.js and python apis
- 📫 How to reach me ...  preferences in order:  slack (I try to check in on it every hour to few but can find the notifications distracting), text (if important and you want to interrupt what I'm doing for emergency), email (I like to check email once a day)
- 😄 Pronouns: ... joshua / j / he / him 
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I recently learned to juggle four round objects of the same size and I've taught many people to juggle three objects by starting with the 'secret of the one'
